The [GMDSI tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks) repository provides learners with a comprehensive set of tutorials for self-guided training on decision-support groundwater modelling using Python-based tools. Although targeted at groundwater modelling, the tutorials are based around model-agnostic tools and readily transferable to other environmental modelling workflows. The tutorials are divided into three parts. The first covers fundamental theoretical concepts. These are intended as background reading for reference on an as-needed basis. Tutorials in the second part introduce learners to some of the core concepts of parameter estimation in a groundwater modelling context, as well as provide a gentle introduction to the PEST, [PEST++](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp) and [pyemu](https://github.com/pypest/pyemu) software. Lastly, the third part demonstrates how to implement highly parameterized applied decision-support modelling workflows.
