Hello! I am a Quantitative Hydrogeologist working with the [Radioactive Waste Isolation](https://www.intera.com/services/radioactive-waste/) group at [INTERA Incorporated](https://www.intera.com/). My research interested include 

I received my Ph.D. in Hydrologic Sciences from the [University of California, Davis](https://www.hsgg.ucdavis.edu/) and my B.Sc. in Geology with a Focus on Hydrogeology from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/). Before joining INTERA, I was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Arizona Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences](https://has.arizona.edu/).

When I'm not working on groundwater decision support modeling analyses or debugging issues in my franken-code, you can find me spending time with my wife and 3-year old daughter, riding/working on bikes, and climbing fake rocks.
