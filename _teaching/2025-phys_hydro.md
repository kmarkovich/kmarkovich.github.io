The objectives of Physical Hydrology are to explain, diagnose, and predict the physical processes that govern: 1) the spatial and temporal characteristics of water in its various storage reservoirs (terrestrial, atmospheric, oceanic) and 2) the corresponding fluxes of water between these reservoirs.  To be able to read and interpret the scientific literature on physical hydrology and to be able to work with modern hydrologic datasets.  Topics will include the hydrologic cycle, atmospheric thermodynamics, radiation processes, atmospheric circulation, precipitation and snow processes, unsaturated flow, evapotranspiration, groundwater flow, runoff and streamflow, and watershed modeling.

This course will be taught in Fall 2025. The course repo, which will be updated wiht lectures, homeworks, and solutions as they are developed, can be found [here](https://github.com/kmarkovich/PhysHydro_Fall25).
