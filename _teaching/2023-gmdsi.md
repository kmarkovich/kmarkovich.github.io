The Groundwater Decision Support Modeling Initiative (GMDSI) funded the development of tutorial Jupyter Notebooks aimed at providing theory, concepts, and practical worked examples of using python and pyEMU to conduct PEST++ analyses. The purpose of this short course was to provide additional background and ask questions as the students worked through the notebooks on their own time.

Co-taught with Mike Fienen, Jeremy White, Brioch Hemmings, and Rui Hugman
