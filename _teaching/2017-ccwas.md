Climate Change, Water and Society (CCWAS) is a graduate course that integrates climate science and hydrology with policy to understand the hydroclimatology and its impact upon natural and human systems with a focus on California water issues. This course aims to expose students to theoretical concepts and methods from multiple disciplines, and to provide venues for all students to bring their disciplinary and interdisciplinary training to bear on a common challenge and set of activities. CCWAS is cross-listed as Atmospheric Science (ATM 245), Ecology (ECL 245) and Hydrologic Sciences (HYD 245).

Each year, CCWAS students develop a course project that aims to identify an issue that integrates climate change, hydrology/water resources and societal/social science dimensions.
