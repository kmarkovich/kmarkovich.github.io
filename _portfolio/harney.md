Groundwater overuse and depletion for agricultural irrigation is a global issue that can have profound impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods. Effectively regulating agricultural pumping, however, is a complex challenge that requires stakeholder participation and an understanding of the tradeoffs between competing demands. In collaboration with Mike Fienen (USGS), I am working to develop a proof-of-concept application that combines hydro-economic modeling, scenario-based modeling, and multi-objective optimization to implement pumping curtailment in an over-allocated basin in the Western United States. 

I will be presenting on this work at the [2025 New Mexico Groundwater Conference](https://agwt.org/event/2025-new-mexico-groundwater-conference/). You can download [slides](http://kmarkovich.github.io/files/4C_Markovich_Fienen.pdf) from a recent presentation, given by Mike Fienen, at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the Wisconsin Section of the American Water Resources Association (AWRA).
