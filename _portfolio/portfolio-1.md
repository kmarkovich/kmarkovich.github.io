Groundwater overuse and depletion for agricultural irrigation is a global issue that can have profound impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods. Effectively regulating agricultural pumping, however, is a complex challenge that requires stakeholder participation and an understanding of the tradeoffs between competing demands. We develop a proof-of-concept application that combines hydro-economic modeling, scenario-based modeling, and multi-objective optimization to implement pumping curtailment in an over-allocated basin in the Western United States. Using three optimization scenarios with different management degrees of freedom, we find a range of potential solutions that balance the tradeoff between profit and groundwater discharge to springs, even when subject to the constraints of a prior appropriation water rights system.
